# Product steering
This repository is used by the Signalen product steering group to:

* Collect, store and refine new incoming feature requests
* Document the product steering group workflow and decisions making process.
* A Wiki collect and store product management related knowledge needed to perform our work.

## How to create a new feature request
If you have a new idea for Signalen or need a specific feature we love you to create a feature request.
You can do this as follows:

1. Check all the feature requests to make sure you feature is not already listed. If you see a related issue we welcome you to comment on exisiting issues
2. If there are no issues which cover your feature requst you can create an issue here: https://github.com/Signalen/product-steering/issues or go straigth to the form via: https://github.com/Signalen/product-steering/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE-REQUEST%5D)

Every 2 weeks the product steering group will check incoming feature requests and may reach out to you for clarification or ask you to join the product steering group to discuss your feature request. And they will be prioritized and selected on our Product Backlog here: https://github.com/orgs/Signalen/projects/2

## Product steering meeting notes
