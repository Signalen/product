## Update Jacco

Jacco shares draft program from community meeting. Would be nice to have keynote speaker who can share experience about working in open-source with community and governemnt. Theme of community meeting is onboarding of new interested municipalities to start using Signalen and sharing learning experiences of municipalities who are already testing and using Signalen.

Result fieldlab, there are market parties interested in using Signalen. Talkgin about how to work together with vendors will also be part of the community day. Jacco will also want to give every participant a demo environment of Signalen.
Feedback is positive on the agenda. Bram mentions to also make target audience clear in program.

Jacco will work on program with Alba and Felix. Will gather input and feedback from Astrid and Bram. 

The sprint review meeting will be repurposed to a community call and a seperate sprint review will be planned in the coming month.

## Update implementation guide
Felix showed generic user manual on https://docs.signalen.org and explained everyone can add or change content. Bram was interested to also include learnings of Den Bosch into the website. Felix mentioned everyone is free to add and contribute and if they want some information or demo on how to do that just reach out.

Arvid is available to create implementation guide. Arjo proposed to include writing implementation guide as part of the implementation work Arvid is doing for Almere. Arjo will discuss this with his team and report back in next product steering meeting.

## Centralized issue management
Arvid and Felix will put epics and feature requests from Amsterdam on the product steering repo. We will also invite Amy van Sommeren from Den Bosch to join that meeting. After having collected those we can have more product steering discussion about all the epics on the table which will form the basis for a first roadmap.

## Website update
The signalen website now has a news section where we can publish articles or information relevant to the Signalen community.
Felix asked everyone if they have something to share which is releveant to put an article on GitHub or send a suggestion to the Signalen mailinglist.

Furthermore these notes will be put on the https://github.com/Signalen/product-steering repository.

## Joint mission / Vision
We also briefly discussed working on a joint mission and vision action point. For now we keep it on the list and continue to work on it after we have made some progress with centralizing all feature epics. 
Here is a work-in-progress example the mission and vision for OpenZaak https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/17d32ea48bd69238776410f8a7375681745c612f/OpenZaak_Mission_Vision_Scope.md
Reason why describing this is important is outlined in the standard for public code: https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/document-objectives.html
